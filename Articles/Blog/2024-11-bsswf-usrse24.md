The US Research Software Engineer Association warmly welcomed the Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship with several events this year at US-RSE’24. Elsa was center stage at the conference banquet introducing the BSSw Fellowship and our 2024 Fellows. Mary Ann and Erik hosted a lively gathering during the poster happy hour. The poster introduced the fellowship, highlighted several projects, had gold stars and attracted lots of questions. Erik hosted a birds-of-a-feather panel where Honorable Mentions and Fellows introduced themselves, their work in improving software and had conversations with conference attendees. We were also able to pass out our first edition BSSw pins, which turned out to be the perfect compliment to the US-RSE'24 pins passed out by the conference organizers. Several current and previous Fellows and Honorable Mentions were active in other areas of the conference as well. For example, Daniel Katz, Keith Beattie and Kristina Riemer were part of the organizing committee and Antigoni Georgiadou was a volunteer.  Kristina Riemer and Helen Kershaw presented talks, “A Rising Tide: One model for improving research software use in the life sciences, ” and “Student Research Software Engineers: Insights from Macro and Micro Perspectives,” respectively. All together the conference was a big success for the BSSw Fellowship community and one we look forward to participating in again next year!
