The [US Research Software Engineer Association](https://us-rse.org) warmly welcomed the [Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship](https://bssw.io/fellowship) community with several events this year at [US-RSEâ€™24](https://us-rse.org/usrse24). Elsa Gonsiorowski, Coordinator of the BSSw Fellowship Program, was center stage at the conference banquet, introducing the BSSw Fellowship Program and our 2024 Fellows and Honorable Mentions. Mary Ann Leung and Erik Palmer hosted a lively gathering during the poster happy hour. The poster introduced the fellowship, highlighted several projects, and attracted lots of questions. Erik hosted a birds-of-a-feather panel where BSSw Honorable Mentions and Fellows introduced themselves, their work in improving software, and had conversations with conference attendees. We also passed out our first edition BSSw pins to Fellows and Honorable Mentions, which turned out to be the perfect complement to the US-RSE'24 pins distributed by the conference organizers.

Several current and previous Fellows and Honorable Mentions were active in other areas of the conference as well. For example, Daniel Katz, Keith Beattie and Kristina Riemer were part of the organizing committee, and Antigoni Georgiadou was a volunteer.  Kristina Riemer and Helen Kershaw presented talks on *A Rising Tide: One model for improving research software use in the life sciences* and *Student Research Software Engineers: Insights from Macro and Micro Perspectives*, respectively. 

Altogether, the conference was a big success for the BSSw Fellowship community, and we look forward to participating again next year!
