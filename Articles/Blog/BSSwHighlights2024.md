As we close out 2024 and look ahead to 2025, it’s a great time to reflect on another year of growth and progress for the BSSw.io community. 
This year, we’ve continued to build on our shared mission of improving software sustainability, productivity, and quality. 
Thanks to the ongoing contributions from our community, BSSw.io remains a trusted resource for those striving to make scientific software better.
In this blog post, we highlight articles and blogs that demonstrate the wide-ranging expertise shared on BSSw.io over the past year.
While the journey to better software can sometimes feel like exploring a complex puzzle with only a few pieces at first, we’ve made significant strides by learning from each other, sharing insights, and helping to piece it all together. 
As we move into 2025, we’re excited to keep up the momentum, face new challenges, and maybe even write some flawless code (hey, we can dream!).
Here’s to another year of collaboration, growth, and making software better together. Happy New Year to the entire BSSw community—let’s make 2025 even more awesome!

### Building a better scientific software community through your contributions

The BSSw site remains an open platform for sharing information and experiences related to scientific software issues. If you possess expertise or experiences that can benefit other scientific software teams, we encourage you to [contribute to the BSSw site](https://bssw.io/pages/what-to-contribute-content-for-better-scientific-software). Whether through original articles, blog posts, curated links that highlight web-based content, or [event announcements](https://bssw.io/events), your contributions play a crucial role in fostering a collaborative and supportive environment.

A huge thank you to each and every one of you for making the BSSw community what it is. 
With another year ahead, we’re excited to continue learning, collaborating, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in scientific software. 
We can’t wait to see what we’ll accomplish together—your insights and contributions are what make it all happen!
