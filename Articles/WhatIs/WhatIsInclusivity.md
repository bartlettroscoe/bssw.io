Scientific computing inclusivity encompasses the strategies and practices that promote equal access and participation among individuals from diverse backgrounds and experiences. 
These practices enable individuals to feel secure, respected, and empowered to contribute their unique perspectives and talents without barriers or constraints.
This includes aspects such as accessibility, documentation, user interface, and collaborations. 
Inclusivity and inclusive practices can play a role in improving almost every aspect of a scientific computing project.
The benefits of inclusivity include reducing barriers, increasing productivity, and improving job satisfaction.

To learn more about inclusivity in scientific computing, BSSw.io hosts a collection of articles that explore this topic, providing insights and strategies for fostering inclusivity in scientific computing projects.
These articles cover a range of topics, from the importance of inclusive language and documentation to strategies for creating more accessible/user-friendly software or creating and fostering more inclusive software development teams. 
By exploring these resources, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of the role inclusivity plays in scientific computing and how to implement inclusive practices in their own work.
