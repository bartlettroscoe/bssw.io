Diátaxis (from the Ancient Greek for "across arrangement") is a way of thinking about how to write
and structure documentation.  Placing the needs of documentation readers first, it identifies four
distinct user needs, corresponding to forms of documentation: *tutorials*, *how-to guides*,
*technical reference* and *explanation*.  Organized into a 2D grid with axes spanning from
Acquisition to Application horizontally, and Action to Cognition vertically, the four forms fit into
the four quadants of: Learning (with tutorials), How-To Guides (with goals), Information (with
technical references) and Understanding (with explanations).  In addition to users, this framework
provides value documentation creators and maintainers as it helps them identify where within this
structure new or updated information needs to be added.

In practice, documentation authoring is still a challenging task, even when applying the Diátaxis
approach.  Having this structure in mind can help clarify which of these forms a particular idea
might best fit into.  Certain concepts though can be difficult to categorize, and might fit into
mulitiple locations on the Diátaxis grid.  So like many tools and processes, this approach doesn't
eliminate the complexity of technical work, but provides a conceptual framework that somewhat
simplifies it.
