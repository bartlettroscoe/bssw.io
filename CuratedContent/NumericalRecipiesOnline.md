### Overview
The "Numerical Recipes" series of books provides detailed instructions on implementing a wide variety of numerical algorithms using computer programs.
This series of books is available online.
The material is designed primarily to be *accessible* to scientists and engineers who have no formal background in computer science or numerical methods.
Because of this, topics such as parallelism, scalability, numerical efficiency, and modernity (e.g., performance portability) are not a key focus of the material.
Nonetheless, the series explains the theoretical concepts behind each algorithm and offers practical advice on how to effectively implement the algorithms, including even example code in Fortran and C.

### Content and Structure
The books are organized into chapters, each focusing on a different area of numerical computation.
Key topics covered include:

- **Linear algebra:** Solutions to systems of linear equations, eigenvalue problems, and matrix decompositions
- **Interpolation and extrapolation:** Techniques for estimating values between discrete points of data
- **Integration and differentiation:** Numerical methods for calculating integrals and derivatives
- **Root finding and nonlinear sets of equations:** Algorithms for solving single or multiple equations
- **Optimization:** Techniques for finding the minima or maxima of functions
- **Ordinary differential equations:** Methods for both initial and boundary value problems
- **Partial differential equations:** Numerical approaches to solve PDEs across various domains
- **Statistical description of data:** Basic statistics, fitting models to data, and hypothesis testing
- **Random numbers:** Generation and use of pseudo-random and quasi-random sequences
- **Signal processing:** Fourier and spectral analysis techniques

Of notable absence in the material are methods involving parallelism.

### Usage
While the books are used across various disciplines for educational purposes, they also serve as a quick reference for professionals needing to implement a numerical method.
The clear exposition and code samples help readers apply the techniques to real-world problems.

### Reception and legacy
"Numerical Recipes" has been praised for demystifying complex numerical techniques and making them accessible to a broad audience.
However, the series has faced criticism over the years for the efficiency and modern relevance of some of its algorithms, particularly in the context of high-performance computing.
Despite this, the series remains a valuable resource for those early in their experiences learning and applying numerical methods in science and engineering.
