The ACM emphasizes the significant impact of language in the computing profession through the article [Words Matter](https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/words-matter).  
The suggested word changes not only avoid potentially offensive language but also often result in clearer, more precise terminology.
The article webpage also invites readers to participate in this initiative and submit terms for evaluation and consideration to be added to the list.

This initiative is valuable to readers as it offers practical steps to enhance communication and foster inclusivity in their professional practices.
