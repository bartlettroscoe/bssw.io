This article introduces several *formal*, courses (most of which are available online) with material relevant to High Performance Computing (HPC) and Computational Science and Engineering (CSE).
Some of the material relates to the basic skills needed to *use* HPC/CSE resources (hardware and/or software) while other materials relate to advanced skills needed to *develop* HPC/CSE software.
Some of the courses are free and self-paced.
Others may involve subscription or registration fees and may only be available during specific times or events.
However, courses that require such fees often provide additional benefits, such as access to live subject matter experts in Q&A forums, regular office hours, or the option to earn a certificate of completion or continuing education credits.

### [HPC Carpentry](http://www.hpc-carpentry.org)

The HPC Carpentry website offers teaching resources designed to help newcomers utilize high-performance computing (HPC) systems.
They provide *live* workshops and lessons (both in-person and on-line) aimed at teaching HPC-related software, hardware and data science skills.
It's part of a broader effort to integrate HPC teaching under the [Carpentries](https://software-carpentry.org) umbrella, which includes a diverse global community of scientists and computing enthusiasts.
It's easy to arrange an HPC Carpentry workshop and it's often free.
Just [request a workshop](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/request-workshop/) through their website.

### [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org)

CodeRefinery offers a variety of lessons on tools and practices for researchers working in computational science.
Like Software Carpentries, they focus on skills like version control with Git, collaborative coding, reproducible research, and software documentation.
Their workshops cater to computational scientists who aim to enhance the reproducibility and collaboration in research software development.
CodeRefinery also provides shorter workshops, video tutorials, and special topics such as high-performance computing and data visualization.

### [HPC-Moodle](https://www.hpc-training.org/moodle/)

HPC-Moodle is an online education resource offered by NCSA which offers free, [self-paced courses](https://www.hpc-training.org/moodle/course/index.php?categoryid=11) in HPC, live training webinars and workshops.
HPC-Moodle is sponsored by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.

### [NPTEL](https://nptel.ac.in)

NPTEL is an award winning, free, online educational site located in India that promotes self-paced learning.
A 2019 course ["ACM Winter School on High Performance Computing"](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/128106014) includes over 30 hours of video/lectures delving into such topics as MPI, OpenMP and CUDA.
A 2020 course ["High Performance Computing for Scientists and Engineers"](https://archive.nptel.ac.in/courses/112/105/112105293/) offers a large number of videos/lectures.
Enter `computing` into the `Search for courses` [search bar](https://nptel.ac.in/courses) to find a large variety of courses relevant to HPC/CSE.

### [The Argonne Training Program on Extreme Scale Computing (ATPESC)](https://extremecomputingtraining.anl.gov)

Although it is not an on-line course, the Argonne Training Program on Extreme Scale Computing (ATPESC) is worth including here.
It is a live, hands-on and in-person, HPC/CSE bootcamp occurring the first two-weeks of August each year.
It has been sponsored by Argonne National Labs and the Department of Energy since 2013 and includes lectures from current subject matter experts and practitioners of various academic and DOE institutions within the HPC community.
About 70 participants are selected from among hundreds of applicants.
Travel, lodging and meals are provided.
Applications typically open in the spring.
All lectures from past years are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=atpesc).

### [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com)

FutureLearn is a subscription (and sometimes tuition) based commercial, online IT school.
The FutureLearn course on [high performance computing](https://www.futurelearn.com/degree/the-university-of-edinburgh-high-performance-computing), offered by PRACE and EPCC at The University of Edinburgh, is a 3-6 year long, full on-line, Master's Degree level course.
FutureLearn offers an expansive course catalog with short courses, certificate and degree programs.
For courses relevant to HPC/CSE, browse their catalog of courses on [IT and Computer Science](https://www.futurelearn.com/subjects/it-and-computer-science-courses) or [Science, Engineering and Math](https://www.futurelearn.com/subjects/science-engineering-and-maths-courses)

### [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org)

Coursera is another subscription based, online IT school.
Coursera offers a wide range of high-performance computing (HPC) courses, including specific training for research scientists, computational biologists, and HPC practitioners.
They also feature courses on [parallel computing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-parallel-programming) and other topics related to [computing](https://www.coursera.org/search?query=computational)
Coursera often provides niche courses that delve into nitty-gritty details about a specific vendor's hardware (e.g. NVIDIA GPUs) or software (e.g. AWS, PyTorch)

### [Class Central](https://www.classcentral.com)

Class central does not offer any online courses itself.
However, it is designed to help users find online courses from hundreds of providers for specific topics and purposes.
Class Central aggregates courses from many providers to help you find the best courses on almost any subject, wherever they exist.
For example, searching for [`hpc` and `cse`](https://www.classcentral.com/search?q=hpc+cse) there finds more than a hundred course offerings from providers such as Stanford University, Google and Microsoft.
Class Central also curates any free resources (e.g. lectures) it can find on services like YouTube.
