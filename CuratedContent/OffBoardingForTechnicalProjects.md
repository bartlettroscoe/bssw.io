What happens when someone on a project, specifically a technical contributor, leaves that project?
Even in the best of situations, there is not enough time to get everything done if your project
hasn't already prepared for any such departure with an offboarding plan.

There are many [good resources](https://www.atlassian.com/itsm/esm/offboarding) on the web for
creating an offboarding
[check-list](https://www.strongdm.com/blog/technical-staff-offboarding-checklist) from an HR
viewpoint.  These include important tasks like exit interviews, recovering physical assets, removing
access to internal accounts and resources, etc.  But what are the offboarding issues specific to
software contributors?  The referenced article above from Texas Woman's Univ starts with an
essential observation: The first step to a successful offboarding process is a well-planned
_onboarding_ process.

The day a person starts on a project is the best time to identify what parts of the code base they
are responsible for, where the documentation for it lives, where the tests are and how they are run.
Regularly the team should review these roles and add to them who are the secondary people for each
area so that in the event someone leaves the project (or even is unavailable for a period of time)
that functionality is not abandoned.  Both
[Github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners)
and [Gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/codeowners/) support this via CODEOWNERS files
where people or teams of people can be identified for PR reviews.

Identifying who inherits the code and responsibilities of a person leaving a project is just one of
the many things an onboarding and offboarding process or checklist needs to identify but in this
reviewers opinion, it is an often overlooked and very important step.
