In the article *Building and Sustaining a Community Resource for Best Practices in Scientific Software: The Story of BSSw.io*, the BSSw.io team shares the journey behind the creation of this unique platform and the challenges faced in building a collaborative space dedicated to improving the practice of scientific software development.
Launched in 2017, BSSw.io has become a cornerstone for researchers, developers, and practitioners to exchange knowledge, overcome shared obstacles, and understand and set new best practices for scientific software development.

While there are many resources available on general software engineering, there was a clear gap when it came to addressing the specific needs of scientific softwareâ€”a gap that BSSw.io was created to fill.
This article delves into the challenges, growth, and evolution of the BSSw.io community, highlighting its role in promoting best practices and sparking a cultural shift in the way scientific software is developed.

Whether you're just discovering the site or have been with us since the beginning, this story invites you to learn more about the vision that drives BSSw.io and how you can contribute to its continued success and growth.
