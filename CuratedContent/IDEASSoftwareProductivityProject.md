Focus | Developer productivity and software sustainability for extreme-scale CSE

Advances in next-generation high-performance computing and computational science and engineering (HPC/CSE) applications demanded a variety of complex features, such as performance portability and multiphysics and multiscale capabilities. 
The IDEAS project tackled this complexity by boosting scientific productivity through improved developer productivity, which positively impacted product quality, development time, and staffing resources. 
It also enhanced software sustainability, reducing the cost of maintaining, sustaining, and evolving software capabilities for the future. 
This enabled the efficient creation and support of CSE applications.

As a leading U.S. project focused solely on this challenge, IDEAS incubated, curated, and disseminated knowledge and methodologies to advance scientific discovery and mitigate technical risks. 
Its goal had been to establish a robust, extreme-scale scientific software ecosystem, comprising reusable, high-quality CSE software components, employing best practices, processes, and tools, along with effective outreach mechanisms to promote productivity improvements. 
IDEAS aimed to enhance HPC/CSE productivity, helping teams deliver better, faster, and more affordable application capabilities for extreme-scale computing.

A webinar on the same topic, part of the *[Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](https://ideas-productivity.org/resources/series/hpc-best-practices-webinars/)* series, including some lessons learned about software stewardship and discussing some of the possible futures for the HPC/CSE scientific software community can be found on the [IDEAS Productivity website](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpcbp-080-ideas) as well.

The target audience for these materials consists of all those concerned with the quality and integrity of scientific discoveries based on simulation and analysis. While the challenges of extreme-scale computing has intensified software difficulties, these issues are relevant across all computing scales, given universal increases in complexity and the need to ensure the trustworthiness of computational results.
