Focus | Developer productivity and software sustainability for extreme-scale CSE


Advances in next-generation high performance computing and computational science and engineering (HPC/CSE) applications demand a variety of complex features such as performance portability, multiphysics and multiscale capabilities.
The IDEAS project tackles this complexity by boosting scientific productivity through improved developer productivity (positively impacting product quality, development time, and staffing resources) and software sustainability (reducing the cost of maintaining, sustaining, and evolving software capabilities in the future), enabling efficient creation and support of CSE applications.

As a leading US project focused solely on this challenge, IDEAS incubates, curates, and disseminates knowledge and methodologies to advance scientific discovery and mitigate technical risks. 
Its goal is to establish a robust, extreme-scale scientific software ecosystem, comprising reusable, high-quality CSE software components, employing best practices, processes, and tools, and effective outreach mechanisms for promoting productivity improvements.
IDEAS aims to enhance HPC/CSE productivity, helping teams to deliver better, faster, and more affordable application capabilities for extreme-scale computing. 
Learn more about IDEAS' progress in the paper *[A cast of thousands: How the IDEAS Productivity project has advanced software productivity and sustainability](https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSE.2024.3383799)*. 
A webinar on the same topic, part of the *[Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](https://ideas-productivity.org/resources/series/hpc-best-practices-webinars/)* series, including some lessons learned about software stewardship and discussing some of the possible futures for the HPC/CSE scientific software community can be found on the [IDEAS Productivity website](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpcbp-080-ideas) as well.

The target audience for the above materials are all those who care about the quality and integrity of scientific discoveries based on simulation and analysis. 
While the difficulties of extreme-scale computing intensify software challenges, issues are relevant across all computing scales, given universal increases in complexity and the need to ensure the trustworthiness of computational results.
