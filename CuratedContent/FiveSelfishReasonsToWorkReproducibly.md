Are you selfish enough? How can working reproducibly help you? Many conferences and sponsors are requiring proof of reproducibility, driving scientific software developers to work reproducibly, but how does the same idea benefit you as a scientist or developer?

The five reasons explained in the article are:
* Reproducibility helps to avoid disaster.
* Reproducibility makes it easier to write papers.
* Reproducibility helps reviewers see it your way.
* Reproducibility enables continuity of your work.
* Reproducibility helps to build your reputation.

The author expands on the five reasons with concrete examples and discusses the implications of reproducible work as a scientific researcher.
Although the author presents the ideas in the context of scientific research, the ideas are applicable to scientific software development as well.
So become selfish, read why working reproducibly is beneficial to you and your career, and develop scientific software reproducibly.
