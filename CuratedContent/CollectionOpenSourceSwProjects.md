## A Collection of Guidance and Templates for Open-source Software (OSS) Projects 

<!-- deck text start -->
What better way is there to maintain important documents to help OSS projects than in an open-source repository? Now, there is such a repository with a collection of documents for guidance, governance, examples, and templates for new and existing OSS projects. And as with any open source project, contributions are encouraged.
