# Better Planning

**Homepage:** Strategies for planning in order to improve software productivity, quality, and sustainability.  

**Overview:** 
Improving strategies for planning in order to increase software productivity, quality, and sustainability, while underscoring the unique characteristics of scientific software, including that requirements often change during discovery.

**Child Topics:**

<!--
Addition: Software Engineering [moves from Better Development], Requirements, Design, Software Interoperability
-->
- **Software Process Improvement**
Approaches for improving various aspects of software development, with emphasis on iterative and incremental advances that acknowledge concurrent needs for developing new science capabilities.
<!---Topic order: 1--->

- **Software Engineering**
Procedures and considerations for developing well-engineered, reliable and maintainable software.
<!---Topic order: 2--->

- **Requirements**
Statements about what functions a software product shall perform, including any constraints under which it shall operate but avoiding as much as possible entanglements in how it shall be implemented.
<!---Topic order: 3--->

- **Design**
Major considerations in designing software to meet its scientific objectives and sustainability goals. Because requirements for scientific software often change during scientific discovery, design tends to evolve over time.
<!---Topic order: 4--->

- **Software Interoperability**
The ability of two or more software elements to be used together in an application, without special effort on the part of the user.  Levels of interoperability range from side-by-side usage through various types of interactions between packages.
<!---Topic order: 5--->

- **Software Sustainability**
The ability of software to continue or evolve.  Considerations are often different when viewed from different perspectives (user, developer, manager, funder), but generally relate to resources to maintain or evolve the code, adaptability of the codebase to new uses and new computational platforms.
<!---Topic order: 6--->

- **User Experience Design**
An intentional process of designing for the user experience of a software (or other) product.
