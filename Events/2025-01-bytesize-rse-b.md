This session explores how to ensure the value of design is recognized and integrated into research projects. You’ll learn how to effectively convey the importance of usability to PIs and senior management, demonstrating how good design enhances research outputs by aligning tools and workflows with user needs. We’ll cover strategies for pitching time to focus on usability aspects, emphasizing how early investment in intuitive design saves time, reduces bottlenecks, and improves scientific output down the line. By the end of this session, you’ll be equipped to advocate for design as a critical component of research success and drive better outcomes through thoughtful, user-centered approaches.

Prerequisites: Attendees should have an introductory knowledge of UX Design, e.g. Mark Turner’s 2024 session ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UlYgMLBIdL3AIGKEffqdrdSM30WaHP-YPXqCgE5dL_U/edit#slide=id.p) and [podcast episode](https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com/1326658/episodes/14592968-en-bytesized-rse-user-experience-design-maeg-doherty)).
