Thanks to the Sloan Foundation, we have funding for US-based early career researchers to do research in one of these areas: AI/ML Integration in Scientific Software Development, Scientific Software Sustainability, or Software Education Research. (Software development itself is out of scope for this one, unless directly in support of research in one of those areas, sorry!)

More details here: https://urssi.us/blog/2024/11/22/call-for-proposals-for-the-urssi-early-career-fellowship-program/ 

Feel free to reach out to Nic Weber (nmweber@uw.edu) or Kyle Niemeyer (kyle.niemeyer@oregonstate.edu) with any questions.

Applications are due 15 January 2025 at 11:59 PM PST.
