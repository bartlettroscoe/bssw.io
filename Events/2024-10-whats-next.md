This webinar focuses on practical issues to increase impact of open software projects, including maintenance, community building, discoverability, project management, documentation, licensing, and user needs.

Our speakers will share their experience working with the open source code as part of the CAPITAL project - open source tool that uses machine learning to identify biological concepts from text and link them to relevant ontologies. They will discuss the challenges they have encountered and potential solutions to address these.
